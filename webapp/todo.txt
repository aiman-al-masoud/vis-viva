# Refactoring
-> move game business logic code into Game

# TODO 
-> getter for animation timing on BattleUnit
-> add a couple more battle units
-> extract lang  strings
-> description and rules
-> attributions

# Maybe 
-> cost per battle unit mechanism 
-> better selected unit indicator
-> range of hit
-> better health indicator
-> user signup (maybe)
-> chance of dodging attacks (param of unit)
-> poison effect (maybe for Mushroom)
-> blocking effect/range (can't hit rear)
-> random challenger button
-> add fancy real Component previews in "tutorial part of info"

# Improve

-> don't create new Game as soon as challenge arrives, wait till player accepts it.
-> fix problems in PVC
-> fix mesages lost in transit bug (redundant sends with idempotency)
